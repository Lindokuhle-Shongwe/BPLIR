Hi there,

Thank you for taking an interest in the MSc project. This is to give you a general feel of what to expect in the folder.

1. The "Kalman.rar" has teh STM32F4 code implementation for the project readily setup to interface with hardware description in Appendix A (Circuit Diagram)
2. The loose files are MATLAB Scripts which I believe you will find useful for navigating the project. These are namely the simuling model "Acrobot.slx", teh driver for the simuling project "postroc" and the 
"Kalman_Filter.m"

Please direct any queries or clarifications to lindo.shongwe@gmail.com
